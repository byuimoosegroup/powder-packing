# Powder Packing
> N.B.
>> The current code for this project is located at [this repo](https://github.com/JackHanni/Testing-PowPack). <br>
>> It will be moved here eventually.

## Initial objective
This programme initializes the state of powder that packed down after being poured into a container.
## Secondary objective
Eventually, with that initialized state, the path of least resistant running through it will be calculated.
